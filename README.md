### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. This involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Python**: Core programming language.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For manual data visualization.
* **ydata-profiling**: Used for automated, comprehensive data auditing.

### 📊 Key Insights from EDA
* **Gender Bias**: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
* **Class Matters**: Passengers in 1st Class (Pclass 1) had the highest survival probability, suggesting socioeconomic status was a key factor.
* **Age Distribution**: Most passengers were between 20-40 years old. Children had a higher survival rate in certain classes.
* **Missing Data**: Significant missing values were identified in the `Cabin` and `Age` columns, requiring specific imputation strategies.

### 🚀 How to View the EDA
Because GitHub has limitations rendering complex interactive widgets, I have optimized the notebook for static viewing. 

1. **Static View**: Open [Project_Titanic_Dataset_EDA.ipynb](Project_Titanic_Dataset_EDA.ipynb) directly in GitHub.
2. **Interactive View**: If you want to see the full interactive `ydata-profiling` report, you can run the notebook locally or in Google Colab.
